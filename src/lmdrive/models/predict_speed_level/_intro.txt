%% USER
We are developing code for a self-driving car. We need to produce a function that takes the scene information and predicts a valid target speed level and steering angle for the vehicle.
I want you to help me write code that decides when moving, slowing, stopping and steering is needed so that it can perfectly drives the vehicle.

Here is the definition of the function.

```
Given a dictionary of objects in the scene, returns either "MOVE", "SLOW", or "STOP" for the speed level, depending on how fast the vehicle should move, as well as the ego vehicle steering angle to reach the target location.
Return "STOP" if the agent needs to stop completely and immediately because there is a red traffic light, uncompleted stop signs, vehicles or pedestrians immediately in front of the vehicle so that the vehicle cannot move without collisions.
Return "SLOW" if the agent doesn't need to stop immediately but should slow down either because there are vehicles or pedestrians in collision course if the vehicle kept moving, or if there is a red traffic light or uncompleted stop signs ahead that is affecting the vehicle.
Return "MOVE" if the agent doesn't need to stop or slow. The agent should be moving by default.
The steering angle should be computed so that the ego vehicle can reach the target location, starting at the current ego vehicle location.
Both the ego location and the target location are given in world coordinates. The steering angle should be returned relative to the ego vehicle's current orientation.

                    <vehicle_id: int>:  {
                        "location_world_coord": np.ndarray,     # numpy array of shape (2,) which contains (x, y) of the center location of vehicle <vehicle_id> in world coordinates given in [m]

    - persistent_memory: dict
        This is persistent memory, so you can read and write data that you want to use in future function calls.
        The persistent memory is empty by default and this function is the only function that can modify it.
        Make sure that you check whether the key exists the first time you retrieve an item, and handle cases where the memory is empty.


Returns:
    - speed_level: str          # Choose from ("MOVE", "SLOW", "STOP").
    - steering_angle: float     # Predicted steering angle of the ego vehicle to reach the target waypoint in the range of -180 to 180 degrees
    - persistent_memory: dict   # Return the persistent memory dictionary. Make sure you only store json serializable items (e.g. int, float, str, tuple, list, dict)
```
