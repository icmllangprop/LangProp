Here is an example code that I have written. However, it is not working as expected.

```python
{{ code }}
```

I executed the code, and got an accuracy of {{ int(avg_score * 100) }}%.

$begin
if printed:
    print("There was a print message saying: {{ printed }}")
if exception:
    print("""
The code failed to run because there was an exception.
The exception message was as follows:
{{ exception }}

The inputs to the function were the following:
Inputs:
    - scene_info: {args[0]}
    - persistent_memory: {args[1]}

Resolving this exception is the top priority.
""")
else:
    pred_speed_level, pred_steering, pred_persistent_memory = outputs

    if {{ same_outputs }}:
        print(f"It also seems that the code produces the same output of ```{pred_speed_level}``` for all inputs, which is not the behaviour we want.")

    print(f"""

The code produced incorrect results for the following inputs. The prediction, ground truth label and score were as follows.

Inputs:
    - scene_info: {args[0]}
    - persistent_memory: {args[1]}
Incorrect output:
    - pred_speed_level = {pred_speed_level}
    - pred_steering = {pred_steering}
    - persistent_memory = {pred_persistent_memory}""")
    if label is not None:
        gt_speed_level, gt_steering = label
        print("""
Ground truth label:
    - gt_speed_level = {gt_speed_level}
    - gt_steering = {gt_steering}""")
    print("Score: {{ int(score * 100) }}%")
$end

$begin
if feedback:
    print("""\n{{ feedback }}\n""")
$end

$import _notes.txt

Keeping this in mind, please do the following:

$begin
if exception:
    print("Step 1. Look at the error message carefully and identify the reason why the code failed, and how it can be corrected.")
else:
    print("Step 1. Given the example input and output, identify the reason why the code made a wrong prediction, and how it can be corrected to achieve a good driving score.")
$end

Step 2. Read the code again very carefully. Are there any bugs we've missed? Any edge cases that haven't been considered?
Step 3. Given the above, please describe step by step what the corrected version of the code should do, making sure that you pay close attention to the edge cases.
Step 4. Please rewrite the python function `{{ function_name }}` to achieve a higher score, including all necessary import statements. Write descriptive comments for every line of code.
