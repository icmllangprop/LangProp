Pay very close attention to the following:

- Please think carefully when you decide whether it is necessary to stop or not.
- Some vehicles and pedestrians in view aren't in your way, and stopping all the time would cause disruption.
- On the other hand, if you do see a vehicle or pedestrian in your way, you should stop to prevent an accident.
- Usually the car only moves forward so we only need to brake if vehicles and pedestrians are in front of the car.
- We do not need to brake if the other vehicle or pedestrian is not in collision course with the ego vehicle (e.g. if the other vehicle is in a different lane, we do not need to brake).
- Make sure you pay close attention to the traffic lights and stop signs if they exist.
- Note that the standard vehicle speed when it is moving is around 4.0 - 6.0 m/s.
- Stop signs can be considered completed once the vehicle has slowed down to less than 0.05 m/s, at which point we can resume moving.
