$import _intro.txt

This is a template of the code.

```python
def {{ function_name }}(scene_info: dict, persistent_memory: dict):
    # Write code here
    return speed_level, steering_angle, persistent_memory
```

$import _notes.txt

Keeping this in mind, please do the following:

Step 1. Describe the decision process of determining whether you should move, slow down or stop, given the scene_info observation.
Step 2. Are there any edge cases you can think of? What might be some common failure modes, and how can we prevent them?
Step 3. Provide a python code solution that implements your strategy, including all necessary import statements. Write descriptive comments for every line of code.
