I am writing a python function and it is not working as expected.

```python
{{ code }}
```

I executed the code, and got an accuracy of {{ int(avg_score * 100) }}%.

$begin
if printed:
    print("There was a print message saying: {{ printed }}")
if exception:
    print("""There was an exception as follows: {{ exception }}""")
else:
    if {{ same_outputs }}:
        print("It also seems that the code produces the same output of ```{{ outputs[0] if outputs else '' }}``` for all inputs, which is not the behavior we want.")

    print("""
For the worst case input, the input, output, expected output and score were as follows.

Inputs: {{ inputs[0] if inputs else '' }}
Incorrect code output: {{ outputs[0] if outputs else '' }}
Score: {{ int(score * 100) }}%""")
    if {{ label }}:
        print("Expected output: {{ label }}")
$end

# This was the feedback you've received: {{ feedback }}

Based on the above information, please rewrite the python function `{{ function_name }}` to achieve a higher score, including all necessary import statements.
