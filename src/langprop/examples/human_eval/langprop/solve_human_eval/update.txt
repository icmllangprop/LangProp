The function below is not working as intended.

```python
{{ code }}
```

I executed the code, and got an accuracy of {{ int(avg_score * 100) }}%.

$begin
if printed:
    print("There was a print message saying: {{ printed }}")
if exception:
    print("""The code failed to run because there was an exception. The exception message was as follows: {{ exception }}""")
    print("Resolving this exception is the top priority.")
$end

$begin
if feedback:
    print("""{{ feedback }}""")
$end

Please do the following:

$begin
if exception:
    print("Step 1. Look at the error message carefully and identify the reason why the code failed, and how it can be corrected.")
else:
    print("Step 1. Given the example input and output, identify the reason why the code made a wrong prediction, and how it can be corrected to achieve a good score.")
$end

Step 2. Describe step by step what the code should do in order to achieve its task.
Step 3. Please rewrite the python function `{{ function_name }}` to achieve a higher score, including all necessary import statements.
