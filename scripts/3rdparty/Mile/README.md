     <br/> Our model can drive in the simulator with a driving plan predicted entirely from imagination.
     <br/> From left to right we visualise: RGB input, ground truth bird's-eye view semantic segmentation,
     predicted bird's-eye view segmentation.
     <br/> When the RGB input becomes sepia-coloured, the model is driving in imagination.

## ‚öô Setup
1. Follow `README.md` in `CarlaCode` root directory. It will perform the following steps:
   - Download [CARLA 0.9.10.1](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases/tag/0.9.10.1).

2. Run the setup script from this directory.
   ```
   bash setup.sh
   ```
   This will perform the following steps:
   - Create the [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) environment by running `conda env create`.
   - Install the carla package by running `conda activate mile` followed by `easy_install ${CARLA_ROOT}/PythonAPI/carla/dist/carla-0.9.10-py3.7-linux-x86_64.egg`.
   - Download the model [pre-trained weights](https://github.com/wayveai/mile/releases/download/v1.0/mile.ckpt) into `weights/mile.ckpt`.

## üèÑ Evaluation
### Custom evaluation
Run the following scripts:
   ```
   . settings.sh
   cd ${TEAM_CODE_ROOT}
   bash run/evaluate.sh ${CARLA_PATH} ${SETTING_DIR}/weights/mile.ckpt ${PORT}
   ```
- Run `bash run/evaluate.sh ${CARLA_PATH} ${CHECKPOINT_PATH} ${PORT}`, with 
 `${CARLA_PATH}` the path to the CARLA .sh executable,
`${CHECKPOINT_PATH}` the path to the 
pre-trained weights, and `${PORT}` the port to run CARLA (usually `2000`).

### Offline leaderboard evaluation

   ```
   . settings.sh
   bash ../../scripts/run_evaluation.sh
   ```

## üìñ Data Collection
- Run `bash run/data_collect.sh ${CARLA_PATH} ${DATASET_ROOT} ${PORT}`, with 
 `${CARLA_PATH}` the path to the CARLA .sh executable,
`${DATASET_ROOT}` the path where to save data, and `${PORT}` the port to run CARLA (usually `2000`).

## üèä Training
To train the model from scratch:
- Organise the dataset folder as described in [DATASET.md](DATASET.md).
- Activate the environment with `conda activate mile`.
- Run `python train.py --config mile/configs/mile.yml DATASET.DATAROOT ${DATAROOT}`, with `${DATAROOT}`
the path to the dataset.

## üôå Credits
Thanks to the authors of [End-to-End Urban Driving by Imitating a Reinforcement Learning Coach](https://github.com/zhejz/carla-roach)
for providing a gym wrapper around CARLA making it easy to use, as well as an RL expert to collect data.
